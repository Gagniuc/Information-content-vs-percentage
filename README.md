# Information content vs percentage

<i>Information content vs percentage</i> - is a demonstrative DNA scanner that produces two types of signals. The two signals are calculated from the contents of a user-defined sliding window. One signal is represented by the [self-sequence alignment](https://github.com/Gagniuc/Self-sequence-alignment) values and the other is represented by the relative frequency values of <kbd>C</kbd> plus <kbd>G</kbd> letters. Note that the construction and theory behind the chart of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/Gagniuc/World-smallest-js-chart-v1.0).
